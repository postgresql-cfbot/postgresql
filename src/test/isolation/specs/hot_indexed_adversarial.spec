# Adversarial correctness tests for HOT-indexed (SIU) updates.
#
# Each permutation pins a case that the mid-chain-pointing invariant must
# satisfy: an index entry points at the heap-only version whose key it
# matched, and a chain walk that crosses a HOT-indexed hop drops the arriving
# entry when the crossed-attribute bitmap overlaps the index's key columns
# (no key comparison).  These are
# exactly the cases that historically broke write-amplification-reduction
# designs.

# 6. Snapshot safety of stale-leaf reclaim.  An older REPEATABLE READ reader
#    still sees k=10; a concurrent session then moves the key to 30 and runs an
#    index scan that reaches the live tuple through the stale 10 leaf and may
#    try to reclaim it.  The reclaim is gated on the skipped versions being
#    dead to all transactions, which s3's held snapshot prevents, so s3 must
#    still find the row by k=10 after the scan.

# 7. Reader consistency across a concurrent prune/collapse.  s1's index scan,

#    via the crossed-attribute bitmap; the query must not error and the row count
#    must be consistent.
