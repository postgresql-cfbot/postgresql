 * goo.c
 *     Greedy operator ordering (GOO) join search for large join problems
 *
 * GOO is a deterministic greedy operator ordering algorithm that constructs
 * join relations iteratively, always committing to the cheapest legal join at
 * each step. The algorithm maintains a list of "clumps" (join components),
 * initially one per base relation. At each iteration, it evaluates all legal
 * pairs of clumps, selects the pair that produces the cheapest join according
 * to the planner's cost model, and replaces those two clumps with the
 * resulting joinrel. This continues until only one clump remains.
 *
 * ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY:
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n^3) where n is the number of base relations.
 * - The algorithm performs (n - 1) iterations, merging two clumps each time.
 * - At iteration i, there are (n - i + 1) remaining clumps, requiring
 *   O((n-i)^2) pair evaluations to find the cheapest join.
 * - Total: Sum of (n-i)^2 for i=1 to n-1 ≈ O(n^3)
 *

 *
 * This implementation is based on the algorithm described in:
