 * indexbatch.c
 *	  Batch-based index scan infrastructure for the amgetbatch interface.
 *
 * This module provides the core infrastructure for batch-based index scans,
 * which allow index AMs to return multiple matching TIDs per page in a single
 * call.  The batch ring buffer is owned by the table AM.
 *
 * The ring buffer loads batches in index key space/index scan order.
 *
 * Most functions here are table AM utilities (tableam_util_*), called by
 * table AMs during amgetbatch index scans.  These manage the batch ring
 * buffer's lifecycle and positional state, and help with certain aspects of
 * resource management.  The table AM uses scanPos to return items from
 * batches returned by amgetbatch.
 *
 * There are also some index AM utilities (indexam_util_*), called by index
 * AMs that implement the amgetbatch interface, to help manage resources like
 * memory, locks, and buffer pins.  Index AMs free and unlock batches as
 * described in indexam.sgml.

 *
 * It's safe to release a batch immediately when it was used to read a page
 * that returned no matches to the scan.  Batches actually returned by index
 * AM's amgetbatch routine (i.e. batches for pages with one or more matches)
 * must be released by tableam_util_release_batch, which calls here after the
 * index AM's amkillitemsbatch routine (if any).  Index AMs that use batches
 * should call here to release a batch from their amgetbatch or amgetbitmap
 * routines.
 *
 * The rules for batch ownership differ slightly for amgetbitmap scans; see
 * the amgetbitmap documentation in doc/src/sgml/indexam.sgml for details.
