 *
 * execIndexing.c
 *	  routines for inserting index tuples and enforcing unique and
 *	  exclusion constraints.
 *
 * ExecInsertIndexTuples() is the main entry point.  It's called after
 * inserting a tuple to the heap, and it inserts corresponding index tuples
 * into all indexes.  At the same time, it enforces any unique and
 * exclusion constraints:
 *
 * Unique Indexes
 * --------------
 *
 * Enforcing a unique constraint is straightforward.  When the index AM
 * inserts the tuple to the index, it also checks that there are no
 * conflicting tuples in the index already.  It does so atomically, so that
 * even if two backends try to insert the same key concurrently, only one
 * of them will succeed.  All the logic to ensure atomicity, and to wait
 * for in-progress transactions to finish, is handled by the index AM.
 *
 * If a unique constraint is deferred, we request the index AM to not
 * throw an error if a conflict is found.  Instead, we make note that there
 * was a conflict and return the list of indexes with conflicts to the
 * caller.  The caller must re-check them later, by calling index_insert()
 * with the UNIQUE_CHECK_EXISTING option.
 *
 * Exclusion Constraints
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Exclusion constraints are different from unique indexes in that when the
 * tuple is inserted to the index, the index AM does not check for
 * duplicate keys at the same time.  After the insertion, we perform a
 * separate scan on the index to check for conflicting tuples, and if one
 * is found, we throw an error and the transaction is aborted.  If the
 * conflicting tuple's inserter or deleter is in-progress, we wait for it
 * to finish first.
 *
 * There is a chance of deadlock, if two backends insert a tuple at the
 * same time, and then perform the scan to check for conflicts.  They will
 * find each other's tuple, and both try to wait for each other.  The
 * deadlock detector will detect that, and abort one of the transactions.
 * That's fairly harmless, as one of them was bound to abort with a
 * "duplicate key error" anyway, although you get a different error
 * message.
 *
 * If an exclusion constraint is deferred, we still perform the conflict
 * checking scan immediately after inserting the index tuple.  But instead
 * of throwing an error if a conflict is found, we return that information
 * to the caller.  The caller must re-check them later by calling
 * check_exclusion_constraint().
 *
 * Speculative insertion
 * ---------------------
 *
 * Speculative insertion is a two-phase mechanism used to implement
 * INSERT ... ON CONFLICT.  The tuple is first inserted into the heap
 * and the indexes are updated as usual, but if a constraint is violated,
 * we can still back out of the insertion without aborting the whole
 * transaction.  In an INSERT ... ON CONFLICT statement, if a conflict is
 * detected, the inserted tuple is backed out and the ON CONFLICT action is
 * executed instead.
 *
 * Insertion to a unique index works as usual: the index AM checks for
 * duplicate keys atomically with the insertion.  But instead of throwing
 * an error on a conflict, the speculatively inserted heap tuple is backed
 * out.
 *
 * Exclusion constraints are slightly more complicated.  As mentioned
 * earlier, there is a risk of deadlock when two backends insert the same
 * key concurrently.  That was not a problem for regular insertions, when
 * one of the transactions has to be aborted anyway, but with a speculative
 * insertion we cannot let a deadlock happen, because we only want to back
 * out the speculatively inserted tuple on conflict, not abort the whole
 * transaction.
 *
 * When a backend detects that the speculative insertion conflicts with
 * another in-progress tuple, it has two options:
 *
 * 1. back out the speculatively inserted tuple, then wait for the other
 *	  transaction, and retry. Or,
 * 2. wait for the other transaction, with the speculatively inserted tuple
 *	  still in place.
 *
 * If two backends insert at the same time, and both try to wait for each
 * other, they will deadlock.  So option 2 is not acceptable.  Option 1
 * avoids the deadlock, but it is prone to a livelock instead.  Both
 * transactions will wake up immediately as the other transaction backs
 * out.  Then they both retry, and conflict with each other again, lather,
 * rinse, repeat.
 *
 * To avoid the livelock, one of the backends must back out first, and then
 * wait, while the other one waits without backing out.  It doesn't matter
 * which one backs out, so we employ an arbitrary rule that the transaction
 * with the higher XID backs out.
