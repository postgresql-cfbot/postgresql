# Crash-recovery coverage for HOT-indexed (HOT/SIU) chains.
#
# Build a HOT-indexed chain by repeatedly UPDATEing a single row,
# changing one indexed (non-PK) column each time.  Force a prune so the
# dead chain members collapse to LP_REDIRECT forwarders (with the live
# HOT-indexed version visible via pg_relation_hot_indexed_stats as
# n_hot_indexed > 0).  Crash-recover the primary with stop('immediate')
# so the collapsed chain comes back from WAL or from the FPI.  After
# restart, verify:
#
#   1. an index lookup walking the chain returns the live tuple,
#   2. pg_amcheck (verify_heapam) reports no errors on the relation,
#   3. VACUUM reclaims the collapsed chain (n_hot_indexed drops to 0).

# without a checkpoint forces startup redo to reconstruct the collapsed
# chain from WAL, and wal_consistency_checking = 'all' (set above) compares
# each replayed page against its full-page image, catching any divergence
