test_memtrack tests the memory tracking facilities of PostgreSQL.


Functions
=========
test_allocation(# workers, type of memory, # blocks, block size)

    This function controls the test. It creates a pool of workers and passes them messages
    asking them to allocate or free memory. It verifies the memory is allocated or freed,
    and it confirms the total memory has been freed at the end of the test.

    Like test_shm_queue, this function spawns worker backends which communicate
    through message queues.

    Unlike test_shm_queue, each worker is associatied with two queues, one for requests
    and another for responses. All messages are exchanged between the main test backend
    and the workers. The workers do not communicate with each other.

test_memtrack(# workers, type of memory, # blocks, block size)

    This function is like test_allocation, but it only updates the memory tracking counters
    and does not actually allocate or free memory.


Messages
========
The message sent to the workers
    request type (ALLOCATE or FREE)

    size of each block
