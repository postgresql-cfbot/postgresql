/*
 * fasthash as implemented here has two interfaces:
 *
 * 1) Standalone functions, e.g. fasthash32() for a single value with a
 * known length.
 *
 * 2) Incremental interface. This can used for incorporating multiple
 * inputs. The standalone functions use this internally, so see fasthash64()
 * for an an example of how this works.
 *
 * The incremental interface is especially useful if any of the inputs
 * are NUL-terminated C strings, since the length is not needed ahead
 * of time. This avoids needing to call strlen(). This case is optimized
 * in fasthash_accum_cstring() :
 *
 * fasthash_state hs;
 * fasthash_init(&hs, FH_UNKNOWN_LENGTH, 0);
 * len = fasthash_accum_cstring(&hs, *str);
 * ...
 * return fasthash_final32(&hs, len);
 *
 * Here we pass FH_UNKNOWN_LENGTH as a convention, since passing zero
 * would zero out the internal seed as well. fasthash_accum_cstring()
 * returns the length of the string, which is computed on-the-fly while
 * mixing the string into the hash. Experimentation has found that
 * SMHasher fails unless we incorporate the length, so it is passed to
 * the finalizer as a tweak.
