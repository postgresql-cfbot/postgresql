 * released. Slots marked as EPHEMERAL will be dropped when released or after
 * restarts.  Slots marked TEMPORARY will be dropped at the end of a session
 * or on error.
 *
 * EPHEMERAL is used as a not-quite-ready state when creating persistent
 * slots.  EPHEMERAL slots can be made PERSISTENT by calling
 * ReplicationSlotPersist().  For a slot that goes away at the end of a
 * session, TEMPORARY is the appropriate choice.
