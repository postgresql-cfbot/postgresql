  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <command>LISTEN</command> registers the current session as a
   listener on the notification channel named <replaceable
   class="parameter">channel</replaceable>.
   If the current session is already registered as a listener for
   this notification channel, nothing is done.
  </para>

  <para>
   Channel names can be composed of multiple levels in the form
   <literal>a.b.c</literal> which allows you to organise channel names in
   hierarchy. Listen channels can contain wildcards which match multiple
   notification channels. For example, the notification channels
   <literal>a.b.c</literal>, <literal>a.bc.c</literal> match against the
   listen channel <literal>a.b%.c</literal> (<literal>%</literal> matches
   everything until the end of the level).
  </para>

  <para>
   Whenever the command <command>NOTIFY <replaceable
   class="parameter">channel</replaceable></command> is invoked, either
   by this session or another one connected to the same database, all
   the sessions currently listening on that notification channel are
   notified, and each will in turn notify its connected client
   application.
  </para>

  <para>
   A session can be unregistered for a given notification channel with the
   <command>UNLISTEN</command> command.  A session's listen
   registrations are automatically cleared when the session ends.
  </para>

  <para>
   The method a client application must use to detect notification events depends on
   which <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> application programming interface it
   uses.  With the <application>libpq</application> library, the application issues
   <command>LISTEN</command> as an ordinary SQL command, and then must
   periodically call the function <function>PQnotifies</function> to find out
   whether any notification events have been received.  Other interfaces such as
   <application>libpgtcl</application> provide higher-level methods for handling notify events; indeed,
   with <application>libpgtcl</application> the application programmer should not even issue
   <command>LISTEN</command> or <command>UNLISTEN</command> directly.  See the
   documentation for the interface you are using for more details.

     <para>
      Name of a notification channel. It is a simple string composed of
      multiple levels in the form <literal>a.b.c</literal> where
      <literal>a</literal>, <literal>b</literal> and <literal>c</literal> are
      identifiers which can contain the following wildcards:

       <term><literal>%</literal></term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Match everything until the end of a level. Can only appear at the end
         of a level. For example, the notification channels
         <literal>a.b.c</literal>, <literal>a.bc.c</literal> match against the
         listen channel <literal>a.b%.c</literal>.

       <listitem>
        <para>
         Match everything to the right. Can only appear at the end of the last
         level. For example, the notification channels <literal>a.b</literal>,
         <literal>a.bc.d</literal> match against the listen channel
         <literal>a.b&gt;</literal>.

  <title>Notes</title>

  <para>
   <command>LISTEN</command> takes effect at transaction commit.
   If <command>LISTEN</command> or <command>UNLISTEN</command> is executed
   within a transaction that later rolls back, the set of notification
   channels being listened to is unchanged.
  </para>

  <para>
   A transaction that has executed <command>LISTEN</command> cannot be
   prepared for two-phase commit.
  </para>

  <para>
   There is a race condition when first setting up a listening session:
   if concurrently-committing transactions are sending notify events,
   exactly which of those will the newly listening session receive?
   The answer is that the session will receive all events committed after
   an instant during the transaction's commit step.  But that is slightly
   later than any database state that the transaction could have observed
   in queries.  This leads to the following rule for
   using <command>LISTEN</command>: first execute (and commit!) that
   command, then in a new transaction inspect the database state as needed
   by the application logic, then rely on notifications to find out about
   subsequent changes to the database state.  The first few received
   notifications might refer to updates already observed in the initial
   database inspection, but this is usually harmless.
