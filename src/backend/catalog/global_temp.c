 *
 * global_temp.c
 *	  Global temporary relation management.
 *
 * This tracks all global temporary relations in use across all backends,
 * as well as any local storage created for global temporary relations used
 * in this backend.
 *
 * When a global temporary relation is created or first opened, it is
 * initialized for use, which (for most relkinds) includes creating local
 * storage for it.  All global temporary relations in use and all local
 * storage created is tracked, taking into account (sub)transaction
 * rollback --- a rollback can undo the effects of creating or opening a
 * global temporary relation, including the creation of local storage.  If
 * a global temporary relation is first opened in a (sub)transaction which
 * is then rolled back, it is reinitialized the next time it is opened.
 * When the backend exits, all locally created storage is deleted.
 *
 * Relcache invalidation messages are passed on to code here so that it can
 * deal with other backends dropping global temporary relations.  If a
 * global temporary relation in use by this backed is dropped by another
 * backend, all local storage created for the relation in this backend is
 * deleted the next time a transaction commits.  (It could perhaps be done
 * sooner, but it's not crucial, since such storage will be deleted on
 * backend exit anyway.)
 *
 * A shared hash table is used to track all global temporary relations in
 * use across all databases and all backends.  A "usage count" is kept for
 * each relation, which is a count of the number of backends using it.
 * This is used to prevent operations like ALTER TABLE from altering a
 * global temporary table in a way that would require rewriting its
 * contents, if it's in use by other backends, which cannot be allowed,
 * since there is no way to rewrite the local storage of other backends.
 *
 * A global temporary relation is regarded as "in use" by a backend from
 * the time it is created or first opened until the time it is dropped or
 * the backend exits (or a rollback undoes the creation or opening of the
 * relation).  This means that a backend that executes CREATE GLOBAL TEMP
 * TABLE is counted as using it, even if it never opens it.
 *
 * When a global temporary relation is not in use by any backend, it has no
 * physical storage.  Thus a global temporary relation must have a shared
 * dependency on its tablespace to prevent the tablespace from being
 * dropped while the relation is not being used.
