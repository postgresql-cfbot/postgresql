/*
 * WAL Prohibit States.
 *
 * There are four possible states.  A brand new database cluster is always
 * initially WALPROHIBIT_STATE_READ_WRITE.  If the user tries to make it read
 * only, then we enter the state WALPROHIBIT_STATE_GOING_READ_ONLY.  When the
 * transition is complete, we enter the state WALPROHIBIT_STATE_READ_ONLY.  If
 * the user subsequently tries to make it read write, we will enter the state
 * WALPROHIBIT_STATE_GOING_READ_WRITE.  When that transition is complete, we
 * will enter the state WALPROHIBIT_STATE_READ_WRITE.  These four state
 * transitions are the only ones possible; for example, if we're currently in
 * state WALPROHIBIT_STATE_GOING_READ_ONLY, an attempt to go read-write will
 * produce an error, and a second attempt to go read-only will not cause a state
 * change.  Thus, we can represent the state as a shared-memory counter whose
 * value only ever changes by adding 1.  The initial value at postmaster startup
 * is either 0 or 2, depending on whether the control file specifies the system
 * is starting read-write or read-only.
