THE SHORT VERSION
-----------------

On non-Windows machines, you can execute the testing process
described below by running the following command in this directory:
	make check

This will run the TAP tests to run pg_upgrade, performing an upgrade
from the version in this source tree to a new instance of the same
version.

Testing an upgrade from a different version requires a dump to set up
the contents of this instance, with its set of binaries.  The following
variables are available to control the test:
export olddump=...somewhere/dump.sql	(old version's dump)
export oldinstall=...otherversion/	(old version's install base path)

Finally, the tests can be done by running
	make check

Using the test in this configuration is possible with any dump file.
However, it is recommended to create a dump from the database "regression",
created by running 'make installcheck' from src/test/regress as this covers
most database features and are specific to each major version of Postgres.
