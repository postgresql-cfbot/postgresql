/*
 * Parallel operation works like this:
 *
 * The original, leader thread calls ParallelBackupStart(), which starts
 * the desired number of worker threads, which each enter WaitForCommands().
 *
 * The leader thread dispatches an individual work item to one of the worker
 * threads in DispatchJobForTocEntry().  We send a command string such as
 * "DUMP 1234" or "RESTORE 1234", where 1234 is the TocEntry ID.
 * The worker process receives and decodes the command and passes it to the
 * routine pointed to by AH->WorkerJobDumpPtr or AH->WorkerJobRestorePtr,
 * which are routines of the current archive format.  That routine performs
 * the required action (dump or restore) and returns an integer status code.
 * This is passed back to the leader where we pass it to the
 * ParallelCompletionPtr callback function that was passed to
 * DispatchJobForTocEntry().  The callback function does state updating
 * for the leader control logic in pg_backup_archiver.c.
 *
 * In principle additional archive-format-specific information might be needed
 * in commands or worker status responses, but so far that hasn't proved
 * necessary, since workers have full copies of the ArchiveHandle/TocEntry
 * data structures.  Remember that we have started the workers only after we
 * have read in the catalog.  That's why our worker threads can also
 * access the catalog information.
 *
 * The workerStatus field for each worker is only accessed by the leader, and
 * has one of the following values:
 *		WRKR_NOT_STARTED: we've not yet started this worker
 *		WRKR_IDLE: it's waiting for a command
 *		WRKR_WORKING: it's working on a command
 *		WRKR_TERMINATED: process ended
 * The pstate->te[] entry for each worker is valid when it's in WRKR_WORKING
 * state, and must be NULL in other states.
