/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * repack.c
 *    REPACK a table; formerly known as CLUSTER.  VACUUM FULL also uses
 *    parts of this code.
 *
 * There are two somewhat different ways to rewrite a table.  In non-
 * concurrent mode, it's easy: take AccessExclusiveLock, create a new
 * transient relation, copy the tuples over to the relfilenode of the new
 * relation, swap the relfilenodes, then drop the old relation.
 *
 * In concurrent mode, we lock the table with only ShareUpdateExclusiveLock,
 * then do an initial copy as above.  However, while the tuples are being
 * copied, concurrent transactions could modify the table. To cope with those
 * changes, we rely on logical decoding to obtain them from WAL.  A bgworker
 * consumes WAL while the initial copy is ongoing (to prevent excessive WAL
 * from being reserved), and accumulates the changes in a file.  Once the
 * initial copy is complete, we read the changes from the file and re-apply
 * them on the new heap.  Then we upgrade our ShareUpdateExclusiveLock to
 * AccessExclusiveLock and swap the relfilenodes.  This way, the time we hold
 * a strong lock on the table is much reduced, and the bloat is eliminated.

/*
 * The repack code allows for processing multiple tables at once. Because
 * of this, we cannot just run everything on a single transaction, or we
 * would be forced to acquire exclusive locks on all the tables being
 * clustered, simultaneously --- very likely leading to deadlock.
 *
 * To solve this we follow a similar strategy to VACUUM code, processing each
 * relation in a separate transaction. For this to work, we need to:
 *
 *	- provide a separate memory context so that we can pass information in
 *	  a way that survives across transactions
 *	- start a new transaction every time a new relation is clustered
 *	- check for validity of the information on to-be-clustered relations,
 *	  as someone might have deleted a relation behind our back, or
 *	  clustered one on a different index
 *	- end the transaction
 *
 * The single-relation case does not have any such overhead.
 *
 * We also allow a relation to be repacked following an index, but without
 * naming a specific one.  In that case, the indisclustered bit will be
 * looked up, and an ERROR will be thrown if no so-marked index is found.
