Test programs and libraries for libpq
=====================================

You can manually run a specific test by running:

    ./libpq_pipeline <name of test>

To add a new libpq test to this module you need to edit libpq_pipeline.c. There
you should add the name of your new test to the "print_test_list" function.
Then in main you should do something when this test name is passed to the
program.

If the order in which postgres protocol messages are sent is deterministic for
your test. Then you can generate a trace of these messages using the following
command:

   ./libpq_pipeline mynewtest -t traces/mynewtest.trace

Once you've done that you should make sure that when running "make check"
the generated trace is compared to the expected trace. This is done by adding
your test name to the $cmptrace definition in the t/001_libpq_pipeline.pl file
