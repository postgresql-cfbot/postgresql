/* For GLIBC's malloc, we want to avoid having too many mmap'd memory regions,

 *
 * The default configuration of malloc adapt's its M_MMAP_THRESHOLD and M_TRIM_THRESHOLD
 * dynamically when previoulsy mmaped blocks are freed.
 *
 * This isn't really sufficient for our use case, as we may end up with a trim
 * threshold which repeatedly releases work_mem memory to the system.
 *
 * Instead of letting malloc dynamically tune itself, for values up to 32MB we
 * ensure that work_mem will fit both bellow M_MMAP_THRESHOLD and
 * M_TRIM_THRESHOLD. The rationale for this is that once a backend has allocated
 * this much memory, it is likely to use it again.
 *
 * To keep up with malloc's default behaviour, we set M_TRIM_THRESHOLD to
 * M_MMAP_THRESHOLD * 2 so that work_mem blocks can avoid being released too
 * early.
 *
 * Newer versions of malloc got rid of the MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD upper limit,
 * but we still enforce the values it sets to avoid wasting too much memory if we have a huge
 * work_mem which is used only once.
