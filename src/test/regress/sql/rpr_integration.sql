-- optimization to RPR windows.  Both queries below use the same input
-- frame (ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) with
-- row_number(), whose prosupport handles
-- SupportRequestOptimizeWindowClause and triggers frame rewriting.
-- In the non-RPR baseline the planner rewrites the frame to ROWS
-- UNBOUNDED PRECEDING, while in the RPR case the guard in
-- optimize_window_clauses() blocks the rewrite and the frame is
-- preserved as specified.

-- Non-RPR baseline: the planner rewrites the frame to ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING.

-- ============================================================
-- Verify that find_window_run_conditions() does not push a monotonic

-- determined by pattern matching rather than by a monotonic

-- used to stop evaluating the window function early.

-- ============================================================
-- Verify that PostgreSQL does not merge an RPR window with a non-RPR

-- semantically different from a plain frame-based aggregate, so the

-- specs are used throughout this section because only inline windows
-- are subject to the dedup path; distinct named windows are always
-- kept separate regardless of equivalence.

-- Non-RPR baseline: two inline windows with identical spec are
-- deduped by the planner into a single WindowAgg node, confirming
-- that the dedup path is active for non-RPR windows.

-- ============================================================
-- Verify that inline-window dedup does not merge two RPR windows

-- ============================================================
-- Verify that RPR windows do not use the moving aggregate (inverse

-- reduced frame is not a sliding window; the set of rows included in
-- the frame is determined by pattern matching and cannot be derived
-- incrementally from the previous frame.

-- sum() would normally be eligible for the moving aggregate
-- optimization; under RPR it must be computed from scratch over each
-- reduced frame, and the returned values must match the pattern.
-- Note: inverse-transition selection is not exposed in the plan, so
-- there is no direct EXPLAIN assertion for it.  The structural
-- guarantee is that RPR uses its own navigation mark, distinct from
-- the moving-aggregate mark, so the inverse-transition path is
-- never reached on the RPR side.  This test verifies that
-- separation indirectly: if inverse transition leaked into the RPR
-- path, state would mix across match boundaries and pattern_sum
-- would diverge from the expected output, failing the regression.

-- by the filtered outer rows (o.id IN (5, 10)).

-- RECURSIVE VIEW examples and state that "row pattern matching
-- is prohibited in recursive queries".  The formal rule lives in
-- ISO/IEC 9075-2:2016 7.17 Syntax Rule 3)f): a potentially
-- recursive <with list element> shall not contain a <row pattern
-- measures> or <row pattern common syntax>.  Per 3)e), every
-- <with list element> under WITH RECURSIVE is "potentially
-- recursive", so the rejection covers the base (non-recursive)
-- leg too, not just the self-referencing leg.

-- WITH RECURSIVE: RPR in the base leg is rejected even though the
-- base leg never references the recursive CTE name.

-- Verify that RPR pattern matching works correctly when the input
-- to WindowAgg arrives via an incremental sort.  The index on (id)

-- "ORDER BY id, val" lets the planner use Incremental Sort to order

-- match counts as it would with a plain Sort.

-- attached to the outer scan, with the RPR WindowAgg driven by a
