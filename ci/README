Postgres Continuous Integration (CI)
====================================

Postgres has two forms of CI:

1) All supported branches in the main postgres repository are continuously
   tested via the the the buildfarm. As this covers only the main repository,
   it cannot be used during development of features.

   For details see https://buildfarm.postgresql.org/

2) For not yet merged development work, CI can be enabled for some git hosting
   providers. This allows to test patches on a number of platforms before they
   are merged (or even submitted).


Configuring CI on personal repositories
=======================================

Currently postgres contains CI support utilizing cirrus-ci. cirrus-ci
currently is only available for github.


Enabling cirrus-ci in a github repository
=========================================

To enable cirrus-ci on a repository, go to
https://github.com/marketplace/cirrus-ci and select "Public
Repositories". Then "Install it for free" and "Complete order". The next page
allows to configure which repositories cirrus-ci has access too. Choose the
relevant repository and "Install".

Once enabled on a repository, future commits and pull-requests in that
repository will automatically trigger CI builds. These are visible from the
commit history / PRs, and can also be viewed in the cirrus-ci UI at
https://cirrus-ci.com/github/<username>/<reponame>/
