 * _bt_mkscankey
 *		Build an insertion scan key that contains comparison data from itup
 *		as well as comparator routines appropriate to the key datatypes.
 *
 *		The result is intended for use with _bt_compare() and _bt_truncate().
 *		Callers that don't need to fill out the insertion scankey arguments
 *		(e.g. they use an ad-hoc comparison routine, or only need a scankey
 *		for _bt_truncate()) can pass a NULL index tuple.  The scankey will
 *		be initialized as if an "all truncated" pivot tuple was passed
 *		instead.
 *
 *		Note that we may occasionally have to share lock the metapage to
 *		determine whether or not the keys in the index are expected to be
 *		unique (i.e. if this is a "heapkeyspace" index).  We assume a
 *		heapkeyspace index when caller passes a NULL tuple, allowing index
 *		build callers to avoid accessing the non-existent metapage.  We
 *		also assume that the index is _not_ allequalimage when a NULL tuple
 *		is passed; CREATE INDEX callers call _bt_allequalimage() to set the
 *		field themselves.

 * _bt_keep_natts_fast - fast bitwise variant of _bt_keep_natts.
 *
 * This is exported so that a candidate split point can have its effect on
 * suffix truncation inexpensively evaluated ahead of time when finding a
 * split location.  A naive bitwise approach to datum comparisons is used to
 * save cycles.
 *
 * The approach taken here usually provides the same answer as _bt_keep_natts
 * will (for the same pair of tuples from a heapkeyspace index), since the
 * majority of btree opclasses can never indicate that two datums are equal
 * unless they're bitwise equal after detoasting.  When an index only has
 * "equal image" columns, routine is guaranteed to give the same result as
 * _bt_keep_natts would.
 *
 * Callers can rely on the fact that attributes considered equal here are
 * definitely also equal according to _bt_keep_natts, even when the index uses
 * an opclass or collation that is not "allequalimage"/deduplication-safe.
 * This weaker guarantee is good enough for nbtsplitloc.c caller, since false
 * negatives generally only have the effect of making leaf page splits use a
 * more balanced split point.
