 * know whether a given child has become a backend or is still in the
 * authorization phase).  This is used mainly to keep track of how many
 * children we have and send them appropriate signals when necessary.
 *
 * "Special" children such as the startup, bgwriter and autovacuum launcher
 * tasks are not in this list.  Autovacuum worker and walsender are in it.
 * Also, "dead_end" children are in it: these are children launched just for
 * the purpose of sending a friendly rejection message to a would-be client.
 * We must track them because they are attached to shared memory, but we know
 * they will never become live backends.  dead_end children are not assigned a
 * PMChildSlot.
 *
 * Background workers are in this list, too.
