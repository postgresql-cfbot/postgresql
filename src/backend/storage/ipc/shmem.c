/*
 * POSTGRES processes share one or more regions of shared memory.
 * The shared memory is created by a postmaster and is inherited
 * by each backend via fork() (or, in some ports, via other OS-specific
 * methods).  The routines in this file are used for allocating and
 * binding to shared memory data structures.
 *
 * This module provides facilities to allocate fixed-size as well as resizable
 * structures in shared memory, for things like variables shared between all
 * backend processes. Each such structure has a string name to identify it,
 * specified when it is requested.  shmem_hash.c provides a shared hash table
 * implementation on top of fixed-size structures.
 *
 * Shared memory areas should usually not be allocated after postmaster
 * startup, although we do allow small allocations later for the benefit of
 * extension modules that are loaded after startup.  Despite that allowance,
 * extensions that need shared memory should be added in
 * shared_preload_libraries, because the allowance is quite small and there is
 * no guarantee that any memory is available after startup.
 *
 * Nowadays, there is also another way to allocate shared memory called
 * Dynamic Shared Memory.  See dsm.c for that facility.  One big difference
 * between traditional shared memory handled by shmem.c and dynamic shared
 * memory is that traditional shared memory areas are mapped to the same
 * address in all processes, so you can use normal pointers in shared memory
 * structs.  With Dynamic Shared Memory, you must use offsets or DSA pointers
 * instead.
 *
 * Shared memory managed by shmem.c can never be freed, once allocated.  Each
 * hash table has its own free list, so hash buckets can be reused when an
 * item is deleted.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *
 * To allocate shared memory, you need to register a set of callback functions
 * which handle the lifecycle of the allocation.  In the request_fn callback,
 * call ShmemRequestStruct() with the desired name and size.  When the area is
 * later allocated or attached to, the global variable pointed to by the .ptr
 * option is set to the shared memory location of the allocation.  The init_fn
 * callback can perform additional initialization.
 *
 *	typedef struct MyShmemData {
 *		...
 *	} MyShmemData;
 *
 *	static MyShmemData *MyShmem;
 *
 *	static void my_shmem_request(void *arg);
 *	static void my_shmem_init(void *arg);
 *
 *  const ShmemCallbacks MyShmemCallbacks = {
 *		.request_fn = my_shmem_request,
 *		.init_fn = my_shmem_init,
 *	};
 *
 *	static void
 *	my_shmem_request(void *arg)
 *	{
 *		ShmemRequestStruct(.name = "My shmem area",
 *						   .size = sizeof(MyShmemData),
 *						   .ptr = (void **) &MyShmem,
 *			);
 *	}
 *
 * In builtin PostgreSQL code, add the callbacks to the list in
 * src/include/storage/subsystemlist.h.  In an add-in module, you can register
 * the callbacks by calling RegisterShmemCallbacks(&MyShmemCallbacks) in the
 * extension's _PG_init() function.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 *
 * Initializing shared memory happens in multiple phases.  In the first phase,
 * during postmaster startup, all the request_fn callbacks are called.  Only
 * after all the request_fn callbacks have been called and all the shmem areas
 * have been requested by the ShmemRequestStruct() calls we know how much
 * shared memory we need in total.  After that, postmaster allocates global
 * shared memory segment, and calls all the init_fn callbacks to initialize
 * all the requested shmem areas.
 *
 * In standard Unix-ish environments, individual backends do not need to
 * re-establish their local pointers into shared memory, because they inherit
 * correct values of those variables via fork() from the postmaster.  However,
 * this does not work in the EXEC_BACKEND case.  In ports using EXEC_BACKEND,
 * backend startup also calls the shmem_request callbacks to re-establish the
 * knowledge about each shared memory area, sets the pointer variables
 * (*options->ptr), and calls the attach_fn callback, if any, for additional
 * per-backend setup.
 *
 * Resizable shared memory structures
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * In order to allocate resizable shared memory structures, set
 * ShmemRequestStructOpts::maximum_size to the maximum size that the structure
 * can grow to.  The address space for the maximum size will be reserved at
 * startup, but memory is allocated or freed as the structure grows or shrinks
 * respectively. ShmemRequestStructOpts::size should be set to the initial size
 * of the structure, which is the amount of memory allocated at the startup.
 * Optionally, ShmemRequestStructOpts::minimum_size can be set to the minimum
 * size that the structure can shrink to. After startup, the structure can be
 * resized by calling ShmemResizeStruct(). ShmemResizeStruct() enforces that the
 * new size is within [minimum_size, maximum_size].
 *
 * While resizable structures can be created after the startup, the memory
 * available for them is quite limited.
 *
 * Legacy ShmemInitStruct()/ShmemInitHash() functions
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * ShmemInitStruct()/ShmemInitHash() is another way of registering shmem
 * areas.  It pre-dates the ShmemRequestStruct()/ShmemRequestHash() functions,
 * and should not be used in new code, but as of this writing it is still
 * widely used in extensions.
 *
 * To allocate a shmem area with ShmemInitStruct(), you need to separately
 * register the size needed for the area by calling RequestAddinShmemSpace()
 * from the extension's shmem_request_hook, and allocate the area by calling
 * ShmemInitStruct() from the extension's shmem_startup_hook.  There are no
 * init/attach callbacks.  Instead, the caller of ShmemInitStruct() must check
 * the return status of ShmemInitStruct() and initialize the struct if it was
 * not previously initialized.
 *
 * Calling ShmemAlloc() directly
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * There's a more low-level way of allocating shared memory too: you can call
 * ShmemAlloc() directly.  It's used to implement the higher level mechanisms,
 * and should generally not be called directly.

 * the child processes inherit the struct descriptors and any other
 * per-process state from the postmaster.  In EXEC_BACKEND mode, shmem_request
 * callbacks are *also* called in each backend, at backend startup, to
 * re-establish the struct descriptors.  By calling the same function in both
 * cases, we ensure that all the shmem areas are registered the same way in
 * all processes.
