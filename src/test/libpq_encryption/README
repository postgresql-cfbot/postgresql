Tests for negotiating network encryption method
===============================================


Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Run
    make check PG_TEST_EXTRA=libpq_encryption

XXX You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

XXX Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops a test Postgres
cluster, as well as a test LDAP server.

See src/test/perl/README for more info about running these tests.
