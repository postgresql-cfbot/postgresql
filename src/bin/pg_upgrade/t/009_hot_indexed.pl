# pg_upgrade must preserve HOT-indexed on-disk state.  A relation that has
# accumulated HOT-indexed chains -- including a value cycled away and back
# (ABA), an out-of-line (TOAST) indexed column, and chains collapsed to
# xid-free forwarding stubs by VACUUM -- must come through an upgrade with its
# data intact, its indexes structurally sound, and its chains still scanning
# correctly.  pg_upgrade transfers heap and index files verbatim, so this is
# really a check that the new-state bits (HEAP_INDEXED_UPDATED, collapse stubs)
# are not rejected by pg_upgrade's checks and stay correct on the new cluster.
