This is a set of tests for the src/backend/access/undo/undoread.c module. It
tries to hit various corner cases while writing UNDO records that span
multiple UNDO log segments, UNDO record sets that span multiple chunks, etc.

Since the UNDO log files are rather big (1 TB by default), the test would be
too expensive if we wanted to involve several logs per transaction. Therefore,
these tests assume that UNDO_DEBUG macro was defined during build (see
pg_config_manual.h), making the logs small enough.
