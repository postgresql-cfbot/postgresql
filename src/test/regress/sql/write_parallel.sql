-- results, but also row counts and loop counts for parallel scans, Gathers,
-- and everything in between.  This function filters out the values we can't
-- rely on to be stable.
-- This removes enough info that you might wonder why bother with EXPLAIN
-- ANALYZE at all.  The answer is that we need to see whether the parallel
-- inserts are being done by the workers, the only way is that
-- Create <<tbl_name>> appears in the explain output.
