 * corrupt shared state.  Require genuine, always-lock-free support at compile

 * The == 1 case is a real hazard, not just conservatism: e.g. 64-bit atomics
 * on a 32-bit target may be emulated by libatomic with a process-local lock,
 * which corrupts cross-process shared memory exactly as == 0 would.  So we
 * require == 2 everywhere the macro is trustworthy.
 *
 * The one exception is MSVC compiling as C: its <stdatomic.h> reports
 * ATOMIC_*_LOCK_FREE == 1 for every width even though the atomics are in fact
 * always lock-free on the hardware we target (in C++ mode the same MSVC
 * reports 2, and atomic_is_lock_free() returns true at run time).  We skip the

 *
 * Memory ordering: sequentially consistent.  This is stronger than the
 * documented "no barrier semantics" of pg_atomic_read_u32(), and it is
 * deliberate: a bare memory_order_relaxed load reintroduces a real,
 * reproducible data-loss bug on weak-memory hardware.
 *
 * The traditional implementation reads through a volatile-qualified pointer.
 * A volatile access cannot be reordered *by the compiler* relative to the
 * surrounding code, so consumers that publish a pointer with a
 * barrier-carrying store and then read+dereference it get the dependent load
 * ordered for free.  A C11 memory_order_relaxed atomic load does not carry
 * that compiler-ordering property, and the parallel hash join relies on it:
 * ExecParallelHash reads a freshly published bucket pointer via
 * dsa_pointer_atomic_read() and then dereferences the tuple it points to.
 * With a relaxed load this was observed to lose a tuple on RISC-V --
 * join_hash "extremely_skewed" returns 19999 instead of 20000, intermittently
 * (reproduced here at roughly 1 run in 4 on real rv64 hardware).  seq_cst
 * restores correctness.
 *
 * The cost of the seq_cst *load* is not the ARM regression that was measured
 * for an earlier revision of this work: microbenchmarking on Graviton showed
 * an uncontended ldar is not measurably costlier than a plain ldr, and the
 * ~2% aarch64 read-only regression seen previously was traced to the seq_cst
 * *store* (STLR) in pg_atomic_write_u32, which is now relaxed (see below).
 * So the ordered read is kept for correctness while the write, which was the
 * actual measured cost, is not paid.
 *
 * A cleaner long-term fix is to leave this primitive relaxed (matching the
 * documented contract) and give the specific hash-join consumer the ordering
 * it needs -- e.g. an acquire read at the call site or
 * dsa_pointer_atomic_read_membarrier().  That is a change to core executor /
 * dsa code and is intentionally out of scope for the atomics port; it is
 * noted as follow-up work rather than folded in here.
