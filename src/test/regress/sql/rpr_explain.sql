-- Views and tables in this file are intentionally not dropped,
-- so that pg_upgrade/pg_dump can test RPR syntax serialization.
--
-- This test suite validates EXPLAIN output for RPR queries,
-- including NFA statistics shown in EXPLAIN ANALYZE:
--   - NFA States: peak, total, merged
--   - NFA Contexts: peak, total, pruned
--   - NFA: matched (len min/max/avg), mismatched (len min/max/avg)
--   - NFA: absorbed (len min/max/avg), skipped (len min/max/avg)
--   - Pattern deparse formatting
--   - Multiple output formats (text, JSON, XML)
--
-- Test Coverage:
--   Basic NFA Statistics Tests
--   State Statistics Tests
--   Context Statistics Tests
--   Match Length Statistics Tests
--   Mismatch Length Statistics Tests
--   JSON Format Tests
--   XML Format Tests
--   Multiple Partitions Tests
--   Edge Cases
--   Complex Pattern Tests
--   Real-world Pattern Examples
--   Performance-oriented Tests
--   INITIAL vs no INITIAL comparison
--   Quantifier Variations
--   Regression Tests for Statistics Accuracy
--   Alternation Pattern Tests
