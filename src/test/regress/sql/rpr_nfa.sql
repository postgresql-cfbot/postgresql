-- RPR NFA Tests
-- Tests for Row Pattern Recognition NFA Runtime Execution
-- ============================================================
--
-- This test suite validates the NFA (Non-deterministic Finite
-- Automaton) runtime execution engine in nodeWindowAgg.c,
-- focusing on update_reduced_frame and related functions.
--
-- Test Strategy:
--   Diagonal pattern style using ARRAY flags to explicitly
--   control which pattern variables match at each row.
--
-- Test Coverage:
--   Basic NFA Flow (match->absorb->advance)
--   Absorption Optimization
--   Context Lifecycle Management
--   Advance Phase (Epsilon Transitions)
--   Match Phase (Variable Matching)
--   Frame Boundary Handling
--   State Management (Deduplication)
--   Statistics and Diagnostics
--   Quantifier Runtime Behavior
--   Pathological Pattern Protection
--   Alternation Runtime Behavior
--   Deep Nested Groups
--   SKIP Options (Runtime)
--   INITIAL Mode (Runtime)
--   Frame Boundary Variations
--   Special Partition Cases
--   DEFINE Special Cases
--   Absorption Dynamic Flags
--   Zero-Consumption Cycle Detection
--
-- Responsibility:
--   - NFA runtime execution paths
--   - Context/State lifecycle management
--   - Runtime boundary conditions and protections
--
-- NOT tested here (covered in other files):
--   - Pattern parsing/optimization (rpr_base.sql)
--   - EXPLAIN output (rpr_explain.sql)
--   - PREV/NEXT semantics (rpr.sql)
