  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <command>CLUSTER</command> instructs <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
   to cluster the table specified
   by <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable>
   based on the index specified by
   <replaceable class="parameter">index_name</replaceable>. The index must
   already have been defined on
   <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable>.
  </para>

  <para>
   When a table is clustered, it is physically reordered
   based on the index information. Clustering is a one-time operation:
   when the table is subsequently updated, the changes are
   not clustered.  That is, no attempt is made to store new or
   updated rows according to their index order.  (If one wishes, one can
   periodically recluster by issuing the command again.  Also, setting
   the table's <literal>fillfactor</literal> storage parameter to less than
   100% can aid in preserving cluster ordering during updates, since updated
   rows are kept on the same page if enough space is available there.)
  </para>

  <para>
   When a table is clustered, <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
   remembers which index it was clustered by.  The form
   <command>CLUSTER <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable></command>
   reclusters the table using the same index as before.  You can also
   use the <literal>CLUSTER</literal> or <literal>SET WITHOUT CLUSTER</literal>
   forms of <link linkend="sql-altertable"><command>ALTER TABLE</command></link> to set the index to be used for
   future cluster operations, or to clear any previous setting.
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>CLUSTER</command> without a
   <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable> reclusters all the
   previously-clustered tables in the current database that the calling user
   has privileges for.  This form of <command>CLUSTER</command> cannot be
   executed inside a transaction block. Also, if
   the <literal>CONCURRENTLY</literal> option is used with this form, system
   catalogs and <acronym>TOAST</acronym> tables are not processed.
  </para>

  <para>
   When a table is being clustered, an <literal>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</literal>
   lock is acquired on it. This prevents any other database operations (both
   reads and writes) from operating on the table until
   the <command>CLUSTER</command> is finished. If you want to keep the table
   accessible during the clustering, consider using
   the <literal>CONCURRENTLY</literal> option.

    <term><replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The name (possibly schema-qualified) of a table.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="parameter">index_name</replaceable></term>

    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>VERBOSE</literal></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Prints a progress report as each table is clustered.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>CONCURRENTLY</literal></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Allow other transactions to use the table while it is being clustered.
     </para>

     <para>
      Internally, <command>CLUSTER</command> copies the contents of the table
      (ignoring dead tuples) into a new file, sorted by the specified index,
      and also creates a new file for each index. Then it swaps the old and
      new files for the table and all the indexes, and deletes the old
      files. The <literal>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</literal> lock is needed to make
      sure that the old files do not change during the processing because the
      changes would get lost due to the swap.
     </para>

     <para>
      With the <literal>CONCURRENTLY</literal> option, the <literal>ACCESS
      EXCLUSIVE</literal> lock is only acquired to swap the table and index
      files. The data changes that took place during the creation of the new
      table and index files are captured using logical decoding
      (<xref linkend="logicaldecoding"/>) and applied before
      the <literal>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</literal> lock is requested. Thus the lock
      is typically held only for the time needed to swap the files, which
      should be pretty short. However, the time might still be noticeable if
      too many data changes have been done to the table while
      <command>CLUSTER</command> was waiting for the lock: those changes must
      be processed just before the files are swapped, while the
      <literal>ACCESS EXCLUSIVE</literal> lock is being held. If you are
      worried about this situation, set
      the <link linkend="guc-cluster-max-xclock-time"><varname>cluster_max_xlock_time</varname></link>
      configuration parameter to a value that your applications can tolerate.
     </para>

     <para>
      Note that <command>CLUSTER</command> with the
      the <literal>CONCURRENTLY</literal> option does not try to order the
      rows inserted into the table after the clustering started. Also
      note <command>CLUSTER</command> might fail to complete due to DDL
      commands executed on the table by other transactions during the
      clustering.
     </para>

     <note>
      <para>
       In addition to the temporary space requirements explained below,
       the <literal>CONCURRENTLY</literal> option can add to the usage of
       temporary space a bit more. The reason is that other transactions can
       perform DML operations which cannot be applied to the new file until
       <command>CLUSTER</command> has copied all the tuples from the old
       file. Thus the tuples inserted into the old file during the copying are
       also stored in separately in a temporary file, so they can eventually
       be applied to the new file.
      </para>

      <para>
       Furthermore, the data changes performed during the copying are
       extracted from <link linkend="wal">write-ahead log</link> (WAL), and
       this extraction (decoding) only takes place when certain amount of WAL
       has been written. Therefore, WAL removal can be delayed by this
       threshold. Currently the threshold is equal to the value of
       the <link linkend="guc-wal-segment-size"><varname>wal_segment_size</varname></link>
       configuration parameter.
      </para>
     </note>

        <para>
         The <link linkend="guc-max-replication-slots"><varname>max_replication_slots</varname></link>

  <title>Notes</title>

   <para>
    To cluster a table, one must have the <literal>MAINTAIN</literal> privilege
    on the table.
   </para>

   <para>
    In cases where you are accessing single rows randomly
    within a table, the actual order of the data in the
    table is unimportant. However, if you tend to access some
    data more than others, and there is an index that groups
    them together, you will benefit from using <command>CLUSTER</command>.
    If you are requesting a range of indexed values from a table, or a
    single indexed value that has multiple rows that match,
    <command>CLUSTER</command> will help because once the index identifies the
    table page for the first row that matches, all other rows
    that match are probably already on the same table page,
    and so you save disk accesses and speed up the query.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>CLUSTER</command> can re-sort the table using either an index scan
    on the specified index, or (if the index is a b-tree) a sequential
    scan followed by sorting.  It will attempt to choose the method that
    will be faster, based on planner cost parameters and available statistical
    information.
   </para>

   <para>
    While <command>CLUSTER</command> is running, the <xref
    linkend="guc-search-path"/> is temporarily changed to <literal>pg_catalog,
    pg_temp</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    When an index scan is used, a temporary copy of the table is created that
    contains the table data in the index order.  Temporary copies of each
    index on the table are created as well.  Therefore, you need free space on
    disk at least equal to the sum of the table size and the index sizes.
   </para>

   <para>
    When a sequential scan and sort is used, a temporary sort file is
    also created, so that the peak temporary space requirement is as much
    as double the table size, plus the index sizes.  This method is often
    faster than the index scan method, but if the disk space requirement is
    intolerable, you can disable this choice by temporarily setting <xref
    linkend="guc-enable-sort"/> to <literal>off</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is advisable to set <xref linkend="guc-maintenance-work-mem"/> to
    a reasonably large value (but not more than the amount of RAM you can
    dedicate to the <command>CLUSTER</command> operation) before clustering.
   </para>

   <para>
    Because the planner records statistics about the ordering of
    tables, it is advisable to run <link linkend="sql-analyze"><command>ANALYZE</command></link>
    on the newly clustered table.
    Otherwise, the planner might make poor choices of query plans.
   </para>

   <para>
    Because <command>CLUSTER</command> remembers which indexes are clustered,
    one can cluster the tables one wants clustered manually the first time,
    then set up a periodic maintenance script that executes
    <command>CLUSTER</command> without any parameters, so that the desired tables
    are periodically reclustered.
   </para>

  <para>
    Each backend running <command>CLUSTER</command> will report its progress
    in the <structname>pg_stat_progress_cluster</structname> view. See
    <xref linkend="cluster-progress-reporting"/> for details.
  </para>

   <para>
    Clustering a partitioned table clusters each of its partitions using the
    partition of the specified partitioned index.  When clustering a partitioned
    table, the index may not be omitted.  <command>CLUSTER</command> on a
    partitioned table cannot be executed inside a transaction block.
