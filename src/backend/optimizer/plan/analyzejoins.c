 * the query, since the derived data structures have to be updated too.

 * We search for joins where the same relation is joined to itself on all

 * of the same relation. This allows us to remove the join and replace
 * it with a scan that combines WHERE clauses from both sides. The join
 * clauses themselves assume the form of X = X and can be replaced with
 * NOT NULL clauses.
 *
 * For the sake of simplicity, we don't apply this optimization to special
 * joins. Here is a list of what we could do in some particular cases:
 * 'a a1 semi join a a2': is reduced to inner by reduce_unique_semijoins,
 * and then removed normally.
 * 'a a1 anti join a a2': could simplify to a scan with 'outer quals AND
 * (IS NULL on join columns OR NOT inner quals)'.
 * 'a a1 left join a a2': could simplify to a scan like inner, but without
 * NOT NULL conditions on join columns.
 * 'a a1 left join (a a2 join b)': can't simplify this, because join to b
 * can both remove rows and introduce duplicates.
 *
 * To search for removable joins, we order all the relations on their Oid,
 * go over each set with the same Oid, and consider each pair of relations
 * in this set. We check that both relation are made unique by the same
 * unique index with the same clauses.
 *
 * To remove the join, we mark one of the participating relations as
 * dead, and rewrite all references to it to point to the remaining
 * relation. This includes modifying RestrictInfos, EquivalenceClasses and
 * EquivalenceMembers. We also have to modify the row marks. The join clauses
 * of the removed relation become either restriction or join clauses, based on
 * whether they reference any relations not participating in the removed join.
 *
 * 'targetlist' is the top-level targetlist of query. If it has any references
 * to the removed relations, we update them to point to the remaining ones.
