 *
 * procarray.c
 *	  POSTGRES process array code.
 *
 *
 * This module maintains arrays of PGPROC substructures, as well as associated
 * arrays in ProcGlobal, for all active backends.  Although there are several
 * uses for this, the principal one is as a means of determining the set of
 * currently running transactions.
 *
 * Because of various subtle race conditions it is critical that a backend
 * hold the correct locks while setting or clearing its xid (in
 * ProcGlobal->xids[]/MyProc->xid).  See notes in
 * src/backend/access/transam/README.
 *
 * The process arrays now also include structures representing prepared
 * transactions.  The xid and subxids fields of these are valid, as are the
 * myProcLocks lists.  They can be distinguished from regular backend PGPROCs
 * at need by checking for pid == 0.
 *
 * During hot standby, we don't have PGPROC entries representing transactions
 * running in the primary.  In snapshots taken during recovery, the snapshot
 * contains a Commit-Sequence Number (CSN) which is used to determine which
 * XIDs are still considered as running by the snapshot.

 * State for the GlobalVisTest* family of functions. Those functions can
 * e.g. be used to decide if a deleted row can be removed without violating
 * MVCC semantics: If the deleted row's xmax is not considered to be running
 * by anyone, the row can be removed.
 *
 * To avoid slowing down GetSnapshotData(), we don't calculate a precise
 * cutoff XID while building a snapshot (looking at the frequently changing
 * xmins scales badly). Instead we compute two boundaries while building the
 * snapshot:
 *
 * 1) definitely_needed, indicating that rows deleted by XIDs >=
 *    definitely_needed are definitely still visible.
 *
 * 2) maybe_needed, indicating that rows deleted by XIDs < maybe_needed can
 *    definitely be removed
 *
 * When testing an XID that falls in between the two (i.e. XID >= maybe_needed
 * && XID < definitely_needed), the boundaries can be recomputed (using
 * ComputeXidHorizons()) to get a more accurate answer. This is cheaper than
 * maintaining an accurate value all the time.
 *
 * As it is not cheap to compute accurate boundaries, we limit the number of
 * times that happens in short succession. See GlobalVisTestShouldUpdate().
 *
 *
 * There are three backend lifetime instances of this struct, optimized for
 * different types of relations. As e.g. a normal user defined table in one
 * database is inaccessible to backends connected to another database, a test
 * specific to a relation can be more aggressive than a test for a shared
 * relation.  Currently we track four different states:
 *
 * 1) GlobalVisSharedRels, which only considers an XID's
 *    effects visible-to-everyone if neither snapshots in any database, nor a
 *    replication slot's xmin, nor a replication slot's catalog_xmin might
 *    still consider XID as running.
 *
 * 2) GlobalVisCatalogRels, which only considers an XID's
 *    effects visible-to-everyone if neither snapshots in the current
 *    database, nor a replication slot's xmin, nor a replication slot's
 *    catalog_xmin might still consider XID as running.
 *
 *    I.e. the difference to GlobalVisSharedRels is that
 *    snapshot in other databases are ignored.
 *
 * 3) GlobalVisDataRels, which only considers an XID's
 *    effects visible-to-everyone if neither snapshots in the current
 *    database, nor a replication slot's xmin consider XID as running.
 *
 *    I.e. the difference to GlobalVisCatalogRels is that
 *    replication slot's catalog_xmin is not taken into account.
 *
 * 4) GlobalVisTempRels, which only considers the current session, as temp
 *    tables are not visible to other sessions.
 *
 * GlobalVisTestFor(relation) returns the appropriate state
 * for the relation.
 *
 * The boundaries are FullTransactionIds instead of TransactionIds to avoid
 * wraparound dangers. There e.g. would otherwise exist no procarray state to
 * prevent maybe_needed to become old enough after the GetSnapshotData()
 * call.
 *
 * The typedef is in the header.

/*
 * Determine XID horizons.
 *
 * This is used by wrapper functions like GetOldestNonRemovableTransactionId()
 * (for VACUUM), GetReplicationHorizons() (for hot_standby_feedback), etc as
 * well as "internally" by GlobalVisUpdate() (see comment above struct
 * GlobalVisState).
 *
 * See the definition of ComputeXidHorizonsResult for the various computed
 * horizons.
 *
 * For VACUUM separate horizons (used to decide which deleted tuples must
 * be preserved), for shared and non-shared tables are computed.  For shared
 * relations backends in all databases must be considered, but for non-shared
 * relations that's not required, since only backends in my own database could
 * ever see the tuples in them. Also, we can ignore concurrently running lazy
 * VACUUMs because (a) they must be working on other tables, and (b) they
 * don't need to do snapshot-based lookups.
 *
 * This also computes a horizon used to truncate pg_subtrans. For that
 * backends in all databases have to be considered, and concurrently running
 * lazy VACUUMs cannot be ignored, as they still may perform pg_subtrans
 * accesses.
 *
 * Note: we include all currently running xids in the set of considered xids.
 * This ensures that if a just-started xact has not yet set its snapshot,
 * when it does set the snapshot it cannot set xmin less than what we compute.
 * See notes in src/backend/access/transam/README.
 *
 * Note: despite the above, it's possible for the calculated values to move
 * backwards on repeated calls. The calculated values are conservative, so
 * that anything older is definitely not considered as running by anyone
 * anymore, but the exact values calculated depend on a number of things. For
 * example, if there are no transactions running in the current database, the
 * horizon for normal tables will be latestCompletedXid. If a transaction
 * begins after that, its xmin will include in-progress transactions in other
 * databases that started earlier, so another call will return a lower value.
 * Nonetheless it is safe to vacuum a table in the current database with the
 * first result.  There are also replication-related effects: a walsender
 * process can set its xmin based on transactions that are no longer running
 * on the primary but are still being replayed on the standby, thus possibly
 * making the values go backwards.  In this case there is a possibility that
 * we lose data that the standby would like to have, but unless the standby
 * uses a replication slot to make its xmin persistent there is little we can
 * do about that --- data is only protected if the walsender runs continuously
 * while queries are executed on the standby.  (The Hot Standby code deals
 * with such cases by failing standby queries that needed to access
 * already-removed data, so there's no integrity bug.)
 *
 * Note: the approximate horizons (see definition of GlobalVisState) are
 * updated by the computations done here. That's currently required for
 * correctness and a small optimization. Without doing so it's possible that
 * heap vacuum's call to heap_page_prune_and_freeze() uses a more conservative
 * horizon than later when deciding which tuples can be removed - which the
 * code doesn't expect (breaking HOT).
