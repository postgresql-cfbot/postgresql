 * hot_indexed.h
 *	  Inline-trailing modified-attributes bitmap for HOT-indexed (HOT/SIU)
 *	  tuples.
 *
 * A heap tuple produced by a HOT-indexed UPDATE has HEAP_INDEXED_UPDATED set
 * in t_infomask2 and carries, appended after its normal attribute data, a
 * fixed-size bitmap recording which heap attributes changed at this chain hop
 * (relative to the prior chain member).  Bit (attnum - 1) corresponds to user
 * attribute attnum.
 *
 * The bitmap is ceil(natts / 8) bytes, where natts is the tuple's own
 * attribute count at the time it was written (HeapTupleHeaderGetNatts for a
 * live tuple; preserved separately for a stub, see below).  Its length is not
 * stored as such; it occupies the final HotIndexedBitmapBytes(natts) bytes of
 * the line pointer's item and is located via ItemIdGetLength(), past the
 * attribute data: routines that deform the tuple stop at natts and never see
 * it.
 *
 * Because ADD COLUMN raises the relation's natts without rewriting existing
 * tuples, a chain can hold tuples whose bitmaps were sized for different
 * (smaller) natts than the relation has now.  Consumers therefore size and
 * locate a tuple's bitmap from that tuple's OWN write-time natts
 * (HotIndexedTupleBitmapNatts), never from the relation's current natts.
 * Bit positions are attribute based and identical across sizes, so a smaller
 * bitmap simply ORs into the low bytes of a larger accumulator.
