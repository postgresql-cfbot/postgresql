 *	_bt_search_insert() -- _bt_search() wrapper for inserts
 *
 * Search the tree for a particular scankey, or more precisely for the first
 * leaf page it could be on.  Try to make use of the fastpath optimization's
 * rightmost leaf page cache before actually searching the tree from the root
 * page, though.
 *
 * Return value is a stack of parent-page pointers (though see notes about
 * fastpath optimization and page splits below).  insertstate->buf is set to
 * the address of the leaf-page buffer, which is write-locked and pinned in
 * all cases (if necessary by creating a new empty root page for caller).
 *
 * The fastpath optimization avoids most of the work of searching the tree
 * repeatedly when a single backend inserts successive new tuples on the
 * rightmost leaf page of an index.  A backend cache of the rightmost leaf
 * page is maintained within _bt_insertonpg(), and used here.  The cache is
 * invalidated here when an insert of a non-pivot tuple must take place on a
 * non-rightmost leaf page.
 *
 * The optimization helps with indexes on an auto-incremented field.  It also
 * helps with indexes on datetime columns, as well as indexes with lots of
 * NULL values.  (NULLs usually get inserted in the rightmost page for single
 * column indexes, since they usually get treated as coming after everything
 * else in the key space.  Individual NULL tuples will generally be placed on
 * the rightmost leaf page due to the influence of the heap TID column.)
 *
 * Note that we avoid applying the optimization when there is insufficient
 * space on the rightmost page to fit caller's new item.  This is necessary
 * because we'll need to return a real descent stack when a page split is
 * expected (actually, caller can cope with a leaf page split that uses a NULL
 * stack, but that's very slow and so must be avoided).  Note also that the
 * fastpath optimization acquires the lock on the page conditionally as a way
 * of reducing extra contention when there are concurrent insertions into the
 * rightmost page (we give up if we'd have to wait for the lock).  We assume
 * that it isn't useful to apply the optimization when there is contention,
 * since each per-backend cache won't stay valid for long.

 *		that contains duplicates of the new key.  If there are duplicates on
 *		multiple pages, the correct insertion position might be some page to
 *		the right, rather than the first page.  In that case, this function
 *		moves right to the correct target page.
 *
 *		(In a !heapkeyspace index, there can be multiple pages with the same
 *		high key, where the new tuple could legitimately be placed on.  In
 *		that case, the caller passes the first page containing duplicates,
 *		just like when checkingunique=true.  If that page doesn't have enough
 *		room for the new tuple, this function moves right, trying to find a
 *		legal page that does.)
 *
 *		If 'indexUnchanged' is true, this is for an UPDATE that didn't

 *		entry to point to a successor version.  This hint from the executor
 *		will influence our behavior when the page might have to be split and
 *		we must consider our options.  Bottom-up index deletion can avoid
 *		pathological version-driven page splits, but we only want to go to the
 *		trouble of trying it when we already have moderate confidence that
 *		it's appropriate.  The hint should not significantly affect our
 *		behavior over time unless practically all inserts on to the leaf page
 *		get the hint.
 *
 *		On exit, insertstate buffer contains the chosen insertion page, and
 *		the offset within that page is returned.  If _bt_findinsertloc needed
 *		to move right, the lock and pin on the original page are released, and
 *		the new buffer is exclusively locked and pinned instead.
 *
 *		If insertstate contains cached binary search bounds, we will take
 *		advantage of them.  This avoids repeating comparisons that we made in
 *		_bt_check_unique() already.
